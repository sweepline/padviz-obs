# Precision Gamepad Source
OBS plugin for simple gamepad visualization, made to replace https://github.com/piatf/padviz using XInput directly.

## Installation
1. Download the release and close OBS
2. Overwrite the folders in your obs-studio install with the ones from the zip (eg. data and obs-plugins)
3. Make sure to re-add the plugin for best practice

## TODO
* Outlines (This is ass to do as I have to manually draw the lines...)
* DirectInput (This is even worse...)
